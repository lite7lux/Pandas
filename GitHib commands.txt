1) Create a repository from gitHub from browser (add readme file)

2) Copy the URL from GitHub browser

#Please use all these commands only in the directory when you are in the directory of GitHub repository

3) “git clone {paste the url here}” <— In the terminal, go to the directory where you want to store the files locally and use this command

4) “git status” <— If you want to know the status of the file whether it is up to date or not

5) “git add {name of the file which is changed}” If you make changes and you want to add those changes to commit. (“git add -A” command to add all the files)

6) “git commit -m “{message you want to save with the commit}” ” <— use the command to commit all the changes in your local machine.

7) “git push” <— It will upload the files to GitHub server and you will see it on browser

8) “git pull” <— if you want to download all the files and changes in your local machine committed by other contributors.

(For help, use “git” command and it will give you a list of all the commands)
